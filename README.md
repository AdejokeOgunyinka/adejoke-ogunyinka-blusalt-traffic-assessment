# React + TypeScript + Vite
This is a [React.js](https://react.dev/reference/react) project bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/). It's an imitation of a Traffic Light. The template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. 

## Getting Started
After cloning the project, install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
